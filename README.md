## Third Party code used

- [UIGradient](https://github.com/azixMcAze/Unity-UIGradient) for `Image` and `Text` gradients
- [Unity-Card-UI](https://github.com/ryanslikesocool/Unity-Card-UI). `Expandable` component is based on `CardExpanding2D`

- [muip](https://github.com/Michsky/muip) Animated UI elements like the `loading`, `switch` and `toggle` prefabs are taken from here and scripts added/modified.
